the republic of kenya is named after mount kenya . the origin of the name kenya is not clear , but perhaps linked to the kikuyu , embu and kamba words kirinyaga , kirenyaa and kiinyaa which mean "  god 's resting place   " in all three languages . if so , then the british may not so much have mispronounced it ( 'keenya ' ) , as misspelled it . prehistoric volcanic eruptions of mount kenya ( now extinct ) may have resulted in its association with divinity and creation among the indigenous bantu ethnic groups , who are the native inhabitants of the agricultural land surrounding mount kenya .

the chloroplastidan chloroplasts , or green chloroplasts , are another large , highly diverse primary chloroplast lineage . their host organisms are commonly known as the green algae and land plants . they differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts in that they have lost their phycobilisomes , and contain chlorophyll b instead . most green chloroplasts are ( obviously ) green , though some are n't , like some forms of hæmatococcus pluvialis , due to accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls ' green colors . chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost  the peptidoglycan wall   between their double membrane , and have replaced it with an intermembrane space . some plants seem to have kept the genes for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer , though they 've been repurposed for use in chloroplast division instead .	what do n't chloroplastidan chloroplasts have ?	what have green chloroplasts lost between their double membrane ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.3333333333333333

aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of aristotelian cosmology . in aristotle 's view , the terrestrial sphere contained  four   elements that come to rest at different " natural places " therein . aristotle believed that motionless objects on earth , those composed mostly of the elements earth and water , to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone . he distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their " natural place " ( e.g. , for heavy bodies to fall ) , which led to " natural motion " , and unnatural or forced motion , which required continued application of a force . this theory , based on the everyday experience of how objects move , such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving , had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles , such as the flight of arrows . the place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight , and while the projectile sailed through the air , no discernible efficient cause acts on it . aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile 's path carries the projectile to its target . this explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general .	how many elements did aristotle believe the terrestrial sphere to be made up of ?	how many elements did aristotle believe were in the terrestrial sphere ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

helper t cells express t cell receptors ( tcr ) that recognize antigen bound to class ii mhc molecules . the mhc : antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell 's cd4 co-receptor , which recruits molecules inside the t cell ( e.g. , lck ) that are responsible for the t cell 's activation . helper t cells have a weaker association with the mhc : antigen complex than observed for killer t cells , meaning many receptors ( around 200–300 ) on the helper t cell must be bound by an mhc : antigen in order to activate the helper cell , while killer t cells can be activated by engagement of a single mhc : antigen molecule . helper t cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell . the activation of a resting helper t cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types . cytokine signals produced by helper t cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer t cells . in addition , helper t cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the t cell 's surface , such as  cd40 ligand   ( also called cd154 ) , which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing b cells .	what is a ligand on the cell surface that is upregulated after helper t cell activation ?	what is another name for cd154 ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines , but thinkers such as aristotle and archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force . in part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction , and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion . a fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion , even at a constant velocity . most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by galileo galilei and  sir isaac newton   . with his mathematical insight ,  sir isaac newton   formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years . by the early 20th century , einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light , and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia .	who had mathmatical insite ?	who formulated laws of motion that were not improved on for nearly three hundred years ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

jochi died in  1226   , during his father 's lifetime . some scholars , notably ratchnevsky , have commented on the possibility that jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from genghis khan . rashid al-din reports that the great khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223 , and while his brothers heeded the order , jochi remained in khorasan . juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between jochi and his brothers in the siege of urgench . jochi had attempted to protect urgench from destruction , as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief . he concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by jochi : " genghis khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands . i would be doing a service if i killed my father when he is hunting , made an alliance with sultan muhammad , brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the muslims .

steven barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty , " they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine , or to  use the proceedings as a forum   to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience . " a technical defense may enhance the chances for acquittal but make for more boring proceedings and reduced press coverage . during the vietnam war era , the chicago eight used a political defense , while benjamin spock used a technical defense . in countries such as the united states whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes , some civil disobedients seek jury nullification . over the years , this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as sparf v. united states , which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative , and united states v. dougherty , which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification .	what is a secondary goal of pleading not guilty ?	what is one way to inform the jury and the public of civil disobedience ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.16666666666666666

aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of aristotelian cosmology . in aristotle 's view , the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different " natural places " therein . aristotle believed that motionless objects on earth , those composed mostly of the elements earth and water , to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone . he distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their " natural place " ( e.g. , for heavy bodies to fall ) , which led to " natural motion " , and  unnatural   or forced motion , which required continued application of a force . this theory , based on the everyday experience of how objects move , such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving , had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles , such as the flight of arrows . the place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight , and while the projectile sailed through the air , no discernible efficient cause acts on it . aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile 's path carries the projectile to its target . this explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general .	what did aristotle refer to forced motion as ?	what type of motion required continued application of a force ?	1.0	1.0	0.6666666666666666	0.3333333333333333

with modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light , particle physics has devised a standard model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms . the standard model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed . only four main interactions are known : in order of decreasing strength , they are : strong , electromagnetic , weak , and  gravitational   . :2–10:79 high-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction .	what is the weakest main interaction ?	along with strong , electromagnetic , weak , and strong , what is the fourth main interaction ?	0.6666666666666666	1.0	1.0	0.3333333333333333

newton 's first law of motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force . this law is an extension of galileo 's insight that constant velocity was associated with a  lack of net force   ( see a more detailed description of this below ) . newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium " natural state " in place of the aristotelian idea of the " natural state of rest " . that is , the first law contradicts the intuitive aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity . by making rest physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity , newton 's first law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities . specifically , in systems where objects are moving with different velocities , it is impossible to determine which object is " in motion " and which object is " at rest " . in other words , to phrase matters more technically , the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference , that is , in all frames related by a galilean transformation .	what insight of galileo was associated with constant velocity ?	what did galileo believe constant velocity was associated with ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.8333333333333334

dynamic equilibrium was first described by  galileo   who noticed that certain assumptions of aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic .  galileo   realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an " absolute rest frame " did not exist .  galileo   concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest . this was contrary to aristotle 's notion of a " natural state " of rest that objects with mass naturally approached . simple experiments showed that  galileo   's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct . for example , if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow 's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity , aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it . thus , in an aristotelian universe , the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship . however , when this experiment is actually conducted , the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast , as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it . since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls , the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls . thus , no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity .	who had the idea of a natural state for objects at rest ?	who first described dynamic equilibrium ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.16666666666666666
aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of aristotelian cosmology . in aristotle 's view , the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different " natural places " therein . aristotle believed that motionless objects on earth , those composed mostly of the elements earth and water , to be in their natural place  on the ground   and that they will stay that way if left alone . he distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their " natural place " ( e.g. , for heavy bodies to fall ) , which led to " natural motion " , and unnatural or forced motion , which required continued application of a force . this theory , based on the everyday experience of how objects move , such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving , had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles , such as the flight of arrows . the place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight , and while the projectile sailed through the air , no discernible efficient cause acts on it . aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile 's path carries the projectile to its target . this explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general .	where did aristotle believe the natural place for earth and water elements ?	where did aristotle believe motionless objects on earth to be ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.6666666666666666
the term " imperialism " is often conflated with " colonialism " , however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition . imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one 's superiority , domination and influence upon a person or group of people . robert young writes that while imperialism operates from the center , is a state policy and is developed for  ideological   as well as financial reasons , colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions . colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power . particularly , edward said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating ; " imperialism involved 'the practice , the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory ' , while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory . ' contiguous land empires such as the russian or ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism . :116 thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism , but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism , as it lacks a political focus .

a particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the fermat primality test , which relies on the fact ( fermat 's little theorem ) that np≡n ( mod p ) for any n if p is a prime number . if we have a number b that we want to test for primality , then we work out nb ( mod b ) for a random value of n as our test . a flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers ( the carmichael numbers ) that satisfy the fermat identity even though they are not prime , so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and carmichael numbers . carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers , though , so this test can be useful for practical purposes . more powerful extensions of the fermat primality test , such as the baillie-psw , miller-rabin , and  solovay-strassen tests   , are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number .	what is the name of another compelling continuation of the fermat primality test ?	along with the baillie - psw and miller - rabin , what is a more powerful extension of the fermat primality test ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.16666666666666666

trotsky , and others , believed that the revolution could only succeed in russia as part of a world revolution . lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism . however , after lenin 's death , joseph stalin established 'socialism in one country ' for the soviet union , creating the model for subsequent inward looking stalinist states and purging the early internationalist elements . the internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the americans during the cold war . with the beginning of the new era , the after stalin period called the " thaw " , in the late 1950s , the new political leader  nikita khrushchev   put even more pressure on the soviet-american relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda . in his speech on the un conference in 1960 , he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism , stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders . although the soviet union declared itself anti-imperialist , critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires . some scholars hold that the soviet union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states . it has also been argued that the ussr practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old russian tradition of expansion and control . mao zedong once argued that the soviet union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade . moreover , the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government . non russian marxists within the russian federation and later the ussr , like sultan galiev and vasyl shakhrai , considered the soviet regime a renewed version of the russian imperialism and colonialism .	who was the leader of russia in the 1960 's ?	who was the new political leader of the soviet union in the late 1950s ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

the system of bureaucracy created by kublai khan reflected various cultures in the empire , including that of the han chinese , khitans , jurchens , mongols , and tibetan buddhists . while the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native chinese dynasties , the yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures . the chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native tang , song , as well as khitan liao and jurchen jin dynasties . chinese advisers such as liu bingzhong and yao shu gave strong influence to kublai 's early court , and the central government administration was established within the first decade of kublai 's reign . this government adopted the traditional chinese  tripartite   division of authority among civil , military , and censorial offices , including the central secretariat ( zhongshu sheng ) to manage civil affairs , the privy council ( chinese : 樞密院 ) to manage military affairs , and the censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection . the actual functions of both central and local government institutions , however , showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions , due to the mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance . nevertheless , such a civilian bureaucracy , with the central secretariat as the top institution that was ( directly or indirectly ) responsible for most other governmental agencies ( such as the traditional chinese-style six ministries ) , was created in china . at various times another central government institution called the department of state affairs ( shangshu sheng ) that mainly dealt with finance was established ( such as during the reign of külüg khan or emperor wuzong ) , but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards .	what kind of division of power did kublai 's government have ?	what type of division of authority did kublai ' s government adopt ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
neoclassical economics views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor , capital and land . within labor income distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers . in this perspective , wages and profits are determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor ( worker , capitalist/business owner , landlord ) . thus , in a market economy , inequality is a reflection of the  productivity gap   between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions .	what is the term that describes the difference between what higher paid and lower paid professionals earn ?	in a market economy , inequality is a reflection of what ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.5

until the early 1980s , industry was a major source of water pollution . although many plants and factories can be found along the rhine up into  switzerland   , it is along the lower rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated , as the river passes the major cities of cologne , düsseldorf and duisburg . duisburg is the home of europe 's largest inland port and functions as a hub to the sea ports of rotterdam , antwerp and amsterdam . the ruhr , which joins the rhine in duisburg , is nowadays a clean river , thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls , a transition from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures , such as the reforestation of slag and brownfields . the ruhr currently provides the region with drinking water . it contributes 70 m3/s ( 2,500 cu ft/s ) to the rhine . other rivers in the ruhr area , above all , the emscher , still carry a considerable degree of pollution .	what country has the most factories that pollute the rhine ?	plants and factories can be found along the rhine up to what country ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
the smaller the economic inequality , the more waste and pollution is created , resulting in many cases , in more  environmental degradation   . this can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy , it increases their yearly carbon emissions . this relation is expressed by the environmental kuznets curve ( ekc ) . [ not in citation given ] it should be noted here however that in certain cases , with great economic inequality , there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards ( water treatment , filtering , ... ) .... also note that the whole of the increase in  environmental degradation   is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier . if there were fewer people however , this multiplier would be lower , and thus the amount of  environmental degradation   would be lower as well . as such , the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well . if ( as wwf argued ) , population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level ( 1/3 of current levels , so about 2 billion people ) , human inequality can be addressed/corrected , while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage .	what does the current high level of population have a large impact on ?	what is the result of the increase of emissions per person multiplied by a multiplier ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.16666666666666666

tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless , frictionless , unbreakable , and unstretchable . they can be combined with ideal pulleys , which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction . ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string , any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object . by connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys , the tension force on a load can be multiplied . for every string that acts on a load , another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load . however , even though such machines allow for an increase in force , there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load . these tandem effects result ultimately in the  conservation of mechanical energy   since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine .	what is the final effect of adding more and more idea strings to a load ?	what does the tandem effects result in ?	0.8333333333333334	1.0	1.0	0.5

politically , the system of government created by kublai khan was the product of a compromise between mongolian  patrimonial feudalism   and the traditional chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system . nevertheless , socially the educated chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native chinese dynasties . although the traditional chinese elite were not given their share of power , the mongols and the semuren ( various allied groups from central asia and the western end of the empire ) largely remained strangers to the mainstream chinese culture , and this dichotomy gave the yuan regime a somewhat strong " colonial " coloration . the unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic chinese under their rule . the mongols and semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty , and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century . in general there were very few north chinese or southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that persians did so in the ilkhanate . later the yongle emperor of the ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the yuan dynasty . in response to an objection against the use of " barbarians " in his government , the yongle emperor answered : " ... discrimination was used by the mongols during the yuan dynasty , who employed only " mongols and tartars " and discarded northern and southern chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them " .	what mongolian system did kublai 's government compromise with ?	what type of government was created by kublai khan ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.16666666666666666

immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system . it originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease . the earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of athens in 430 bc . thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time . in the 18th century , pierre-louis moreau de maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom . this and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by louis pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease . pasteur 's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease , such as the miasma theory . it was not until robert koch 's 1891 proofs , for which he was awarded a nobel prize in 1905 , that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease . viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901 , with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by  walter reed   .	who discovered the yellow fever virus ?	who wrote the discovery of the yellow fever virus ?	0.8333333333333334	1.0	1.0	0.6666666666666666

an important decision for civil disobedients is  whether or not to plead guilty   . there is much debate on this point , as some believe that it is a civil disobedient 's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law , while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law . it has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience . act-up 's civil disobedience training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating , " yes , i committed the act of which you accuse me . i do n't deny it ; in fact , i am proud of it . i feel i did the right thing by violating this particular law ; i am guilty as charged , " but that pleading not guilty sends a message of , " guilt implies wrong-doing . i feel i have done no wrong . i may have violated some specific laws , but i am guilty of doing no wrong . i therefore plead not guilty . " a plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two . one defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power , when asked to enter his plea , stated , " i plead for the beauty that surrounds us " ; this is known as a " creative plea , " and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty .	what is an important personal decision for civil disobedients ?	what is an important decision for civil disobedients ?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.8333333333333334

politically , the system of government created by kublai khan was the product of a compromise between mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system . nevertheless , socially the educated chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native chinese dynasties . although the traditional chinese elite were not given their share of power , the mongols and the semuren ( various  allied groups from central asia and the western end of the empire   ) largely remained strangers to the mainstream chinese culture , and this dichotomy gave the yuan regime a somewhat strong " colonial " coloration . the unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic chinese under their rule . the mongols and semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty , and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century . in general there were very few north chinese or southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that persians did so in the ilkhanate . later the yongle emperor of the ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the yuan dynasty . in response to an objection against the use of " barbarians " in his government , the yongle emperor answered : " ... discrimination was used by the mongols during the yuan dynasty , who employed only " mongols and tartars " and discarded northern and southern chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them " .	who were the semuren ?	what were the semuren and the semuren ?	0.3333333333333333	1.0	1.0	0.8333333333333334

egyptian president anwar sadat – whose policies included opening egypt to western investment ( infitah ) ; transferring egypt 's allegiance from the soviet union to the united states ; and making peace with israel – released islamists from prison and welcomed home exiles in tacit exchange for political support in his struggle against leftists . his " encouraging of the emergence of the islamist movement " was said to have been " imitated by many other muslim leaders in the years that followed .

the evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus magicicada make use of prime numbers . these insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground . they only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7 , 13 or  17 years   , at which point they fly about , breed , and then die after a few weeks at most . the logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on magicicadas . if magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals , say every 12 years , then predators appearing every 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , or 12 years would be sure to meet them . over a 200-year period , average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2 % higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas . though small , this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects .	other than 7 and 13 , what other year interval do cicadas pupate ?	how many years did the evolutionary strategy emerge from ?	0.6666666666666666	1.0	0.6666666666666666	0.0

the term " imperialism " is often conflated with "  colonialism   " , however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition . imperialism and  colonialism   have been used in order to describe one 's superiority , domination and influence upon a person or group of people . robert young writes that while imperialism operates from the center , is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons ,  colonialism   is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions .  colonialism   in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power . particularly , edward said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and  colonialism   by stating ; " imperialism involved 'the practice , the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory ' , while  colonialism   refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory . ' contiguous land empires such as the russian or ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of  colonialism   . :116 thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of  colonialism   , but  colonialism   itself does not automatically imply imperialism , as it lacks a political focus .

it is usually recognized that lawbreaking , if it is not done publicly , at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience . but stephen eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality , we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking . if a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights , he might , for instance , find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience . this assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations . the fully informed jury association 's publication " a primer for prospective jurors " notes , " think of the dilemma faced by german citizens when hitler 's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a jew in their house .

the concept  environmental determinism   served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples . it was believed that a certain person 's behaviours were determined by the environment in which they lived and thus validated their domination . for example , people living in tropical environments were seen as " less civilized " therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission . across the three waves of european colonialism ( first in the americas , second in asia and lastly in africa ) ,  environmental determinism   was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy . this takes two forms , orientalism and tropicality .	what served as a justification for imposing imperialistic policies on certain peoples or regions ?	what concept served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.8333333333333334

the first british empire was based on  mercantilism   , and involved colonies and holdings primarily in north america , the caribbean , and india . its growth was reversed by the loss of the american colonies in 1776. britain made compensating gains in india , australia , and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in latin america after the independence of spanish and portuguese colonies about 1820. by the 1840s , britain had adopted a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world . after losing its first empire to the americans , britain then turned its attention towards asia , africa , and the pacific . following the defeat of napoleonic france in 1815 , britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe . increasing degrees of internal autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies in the 20th century .	what was the first british empire based on ?	what was the first british empire based on?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

the development of fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines of unification of disparate ideas . for example , isaac newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation . michael faraday and james clerk maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism . in the  20th   century , the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces ( all except gravity ) are manifestations of matter ( fermions ) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons . this standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation . the complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved higgs mechanism , but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete . a grand unified theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics . physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything . einstein tried and failed at this endeavor , but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory . :212–219	in what century was quantum mechanics made ?	quantum mechanics came into being during what century?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
the unproven riemann hypothesis , dating from  1859   , states that except for s = −2 , −4 , ... , all zeroes of the ζ-function have real part equal to 1/2 . the connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible . [ clarification needed ] from a physical viewpoint , it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise . from a mathematical viewpoint , it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes ( about x/log x of numbers less than x are primes , the prime number theorem ) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x ( for intervals near x ) . this hypothesis is generally believed to be correct . in particular , the simplest assumption is that primes should have no significant irregularities without good reason .	when was the riemann hypothesis proposed ?	when was the riemann hypothesis discovered?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
a controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds . j. a. hobson identifies this justification on general grounds as : " it is desirable that the earth should be peopled , governed , and developed , as far as possible , by the races which can do this work best , i.e . by the races of highest 'social efficiency ' " . many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons . friedrich ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive , imperialism was needed . halford mackinder felt that great britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism . the purportedly scientific nature of " social darwinism " and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism . the rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose , for example throughout latin america "  whiteness   " is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento ( whitening ) are common .	in latin america what is the most revered skin color ?	what does john locke argue imperialism promotes?	1.0	0.6666666666666666	0.3333333333333333	0.0

wealth concentration is a theoretical [ according to whom ? ] process by which , under certain conditions , newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities . according to this theory , those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth , thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth . over time , wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society . thomas piketty in his book capital in the twenty-first century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital ( r ) than economic growth ( g ) , and that larger fortunes generate  higher returns   [ pp . 384 table 12.2 , u.s. university endowment size vs. real annual rate of return ]	what do larger fortunes generate ?	what does piketty claim will happen to investors when wealth concentration occurs?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.3333333333333333

economist joseph stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income , market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration , which may better be explained by the non-market force known as " rent-seeking " . while the market will bid up compensation for  rare and desired   skills to reward wealth creation , greater productivity , etc. , it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices , profits and large compensation . a better explainer of growing inequality , according to stiglitz , is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them . this process , known to economists as rent-seeking , brings income not from creation of wealth but from " grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort "	what type of skills does the market bid up compensation for ?	what kind of skills does the market bid up compensation for?	0.8333333333333334	1.0	1.0	1.0

during the mass high school education movement from  1910–1940   , there was an increase in skilled workers , which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor . high school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work . in fact , it differs from the present high school education , which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees . this decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers . education is very important for the growth of the economy , however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy . lagerlof and galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth , and continued gender inequality in education , thus creating a poverty trap . it is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth , which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries .	when did the high school education movement occur ?	during what time period was there a mass high school education movement?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.5

killer t cells   are a sub-group of t cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses ( and other pathogens ) , or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional . as with b cells , each type of t cell recognizes a different antigen .  killer t cells   are activated when their t cell receptor ( tcr ) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the mhc class i receptor of another cell . recognition of this mhc : antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the t cell , called cd8 . the t cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the mhc i receptors bear this antigen . when an activated t cell contacts such cells , it releases cytotoxins , such as perforin , which form pores in the target cell 's plasma membrane , allowing ions , water and toxins to enter . the entry of another toxin called granulysin ( a protease ) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis . t cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses . t cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong mhc/antigen activation signal , or additional activation signals provided by " helper " t cells ( see below ) .	what kind of t cells kill cells that are infected with pathogens ?	what sub-group of t cells kill cells that are infected with viruses?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

in 1962 , graphic designer paul rand redesigned the abc logo into its best-known ( and current ) form , with the lowercase letters " abc " enclosed in a single black circle . the new logo debuted on-air for abc 's promos at the start of the  1963–64 season   . the letters are strongly reminiscent of the bauhaus typeface designed by herbert bayer in the 1920s , but also share similarities with several other fonts , such as itc avant garde and horatio , and most closely resembling chalet . the logo 's simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate , which conferred a benefit for abc ( mostly before the advent of computer graphics ) .	when did paul rand 's iconic abc logo first debut ?	during what television season did the new logo appear?	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.6666666666666666
justifying grace or accepting grace is that grace , offered by god to all people , that we receive by faith and trust in christ , through which god pardons the believer of sin . it is in justifying grace we are received by god , in spite of our sin . in this reception , we are forgiven through the atoning work of jesus christ on the cross . the justifying grace cancels our guilt and empowers us to resist the power of sin and to fully love god and neighbor . today , justifying grace is also known as  conversion   , " accepting jesus as your personal lord and savior , " or being " born again " . john wesley originally called this experience the new birth . this experience can occur in different ways ; it can be one transforming moment , such as an altar call experience , or it may involve a series of decisions across a period of time .	what is justifying grace also known as today ?	what do christians do that is a sign of his or her commitment to his	0.0	0.6666666666666666	0.6666666666666666	0.0
immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive . the ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly , with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence . in developed countries , obesity , alcoholism , and drug use are common causes of poor immune function . however ,  malnutrition   is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries . diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity , complement activity , phagocyte function , iga antibody concentrations , and cytokine production . additionally , the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection .	what is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing nations ?	what is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

with modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light , particle physics has devised a standard model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms . the standard model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed . only four main interactions are known : in order of decreasing strength , they are : strong , electromagnetic , weak , and  gravitational   . :2–10:79 high-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction .	what is the weakest main interaction ?	what is the strongest interaction predicted by the standard model?	1.0	1.0	0.6666666666666666	0.0
the first british empire was based on mercantilism , and involved colonies and holdings primarily in north america , the caribbean , and india . its growth was reversed by the loss of the american colonies in 1776. britain made compensating gains in india , australia , and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in latin america after the independence of spanish and portuguese colonies  about 1820.   by the 1840s , britain had adopted a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world . after losing its first empire to the americans , britain then turned its attention towards asia , africa , and the pacific . following the defeat of napoleonic france in 1815 , britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe . increasing degrees of internal autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies in the 20th century .	when did the spanish and portuguese colonies gain their independance .	when did the spanish and portuguese colonies gain independence from britain	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.6666666666666666
