For example, Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation. Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything.

Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice.

In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held, among others, by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring, stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism’s “humors” rather than its cells.", "reference": "Under Elie Metchnikoff's cellular theory, what cells were responsible for immune response?", "answer": "phagocytes", "questions": [{"prediction": "Who was responsible for the cellular theory of immunity?", "source": "SQuAD_GPT-3.5-turbo_fewshot", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 1.0}, {"prediction": "According to the cellular theory of immunity, what cells were responsible for immune responses?", "source": "SQuAD_T5-large_finetune", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 3.0}, {"prediction": "What cells are responsible for immune responses according to the cellular theory of immunity?", "source": "SQuAD_BART-base_finetune", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 3.0}, {"prediction": "What did Elie Metchnikoff believe were responsible for immune responses?", "source": "SQuAD_BART-large_finetune", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 3.0}, {"prediction": "According to the cellular theory of immunity, what were responsible for immune responses?", "source": "SQuAD_FlanT5-xxl_fewshot", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 3.0}, {"prediction": "What cells were responsible for immune responses?", "source": "SQuAD_FlanT5-xl_lora", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 3.0}, {"prediction": "What are cells called in the cellular theory of immunity?", "source": "SQuAD_T5-base_finetune", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 2.6667, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 1.6667, "answer_consistency": 1.6667}, {"prediction": "What type of cells did Elie Metchnikoff propose were responsible for immune responses according to the cellular theory of immunity developed at the turn of the 20th century?", "source": "SQuAD_GPT-4-1106-preview_zeroshot", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 3.0}, {"prediction": "What is the cellular theory of immunity and who did it propose were responsible for immune responses?", "source": "SQuAD_GPT-3.5-turbo_zeroshot", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 2.6667}, {"prediction": "What type of cells were responsible for immune responses?", "source": "SQuAD_FlanT5-base_finetune", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 2.6667, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 2.6667, "answer_consistency": 2.6667}, {"prediction": "Which cells did Elie Metchnikoff believe were responsible for immune responses according to the cellular theory of immunity?", "source": "SQuAD_GPT-4-1106-preview_fewshot", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 3.0}, {"prediction": "What cells were responsible for immune responses according to the cellular theory of immunity?", "source": "SQuAD_FlanT5-xxl_lora", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 3.0}, {"prediction": "What were the cells responsible for immune responses?", "source": "SQuAD_FlanT5-xl_fewshot", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 3.0}, {"prediction": "What cells were responsible for immune responses according to the cellular theory of immunology?", "source": "SQuAD_FlanT5-large_finetune", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 3.0}, {"prediction": "Under Elie Metchnikoff's cellular theory, what cells were responsible for immune response?", "source": "SQuAD_reference", "fluency": 3.0, "clarity": 3.0, "conciseness": 3.0, "relevance": 3.0, "consistency": 3.0, "answerability": 3.0, "answer_consistency": 3.0}]}, {"id": "57273ef15951b619008f8752", "passage": "On May 1, 1953, ABC's New York City flagship stations – WJZ, WJZ-FM and WJZ-TV – changed their respective callsigns to WABC, WABC-FM and WABC-TV, and moved their operations to facilities at 7 West 66th Street, one block away from Central Park.

It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama, Canadian Sydney Newman, was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.[note 1] The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"bug-eyed monsters\". The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but The Mutants was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it. According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice — we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial – The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.", "reference": "What creatures were the most popular monsters in the series?", "answer": "The Daleks (a.k.a.
